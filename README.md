- The app loads songs dynamically from `JSON files` using the `fetch()` API.  
- Each song’s metadata (title, artist, duration) is rendered dynamically in the playlist.  
- JavaScript dynamically creates UI cards for each track.
- Song duration updates after metadata loads.
- Playback controls handled via event listeners.
- The player responds to both click and touch events for universal compatibility.  
- Real-time progress updates and section toggling enhance interactivity.
