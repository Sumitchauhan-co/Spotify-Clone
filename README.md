## 🚀 Project Overview

This initiative replicates core streaming-app behavior through a lightweight, high-performance front-end stack.
The solution delivers a seamless playback experience featuring dynamic routing, JSON-based song management, and a custom audio engine built using JavaScript’s Audio() API.

---
## 🔧 Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Multi-page setup with reusable components and clean separation of concerns.
- **Dynamic Music Loader**: Songs, metadata, and assets sourced directly from JSON.
- **Custom Audio Engine** supporting:
    - Play / Pause
    - Next / Previous
    - Seek Control
    - Volume Slider with real-time audio binding
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet & desktop screens.
- **State Persistence**: Retains last-used volume & playback states.
- **Smooth UI Interactions**: Animated transitions, skeleton loaders, event-driven updates.

## 🧩 Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ES6)
- **Data Source:** JSON-driven playlist structure
- **Version Control:** Git + Github
- **Deployement:** GitHub Pages  

---

## ▶ How It Works

- App initializes a playlist from songs.json.
- When a track is selected, JavaScript dynamically creates a new Audio(src) object.
- UI components (seek bar, volume slider, buttons) sync in real time via event listeners.
- Playback state persists and carries across tracks for consistent user experience.
